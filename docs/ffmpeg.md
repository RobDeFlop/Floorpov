# Bundled FFmpeg Binary (Not Tracked in Git)

FloorPoV uses a private FFmpeg binary for its legacy recording backend.
FFmpeg remains the bundled production default while the native Windows backend is validated.
The binary is bundled into app resources at build time, but it is not committed to git.

Set `FLOORPOV_RECORDING_BACKEND=ffmpeg` to force this backend. See
[`native-recording.md`](native-recording.md) for rollout and backend-selection details.

## Why this setup

- Users do not need to install FFmpeg separately.
- Repository size stays small.
- Build remains reproducible by pinning version + SHA256 checksums.

## Config

Pinned FFmpeg metadata lives in:

- `build/ffmpeg.json`

The archive URL should point to a fixed GitHub release asset (for example `GyanD/codexffmpeg` tag `8.1`).

For now, the project includes `win-x64` metadata.

## Fetch command

Run before Tauri build:

```powershell
bun run prepare:ffmpeg
```

This script:

1. Downloads the pinned FFmpeg archive.
2. Verifies archive SHA256.
3. Extracts `ffmpeg.exe` from the archive.
4. Verifies `ffmpeg.exe` SHA256.
5. Places the binary at:

- `src-tauri/bin/ffmpeg.exe`

## Git tracking

The binary is ignored by git:

- `src-tauri/bin/ffmpeg.exe`

Only scripts and metadata are tracked.

## Build integration

The Tauri bundle already includes `src-tauri/bin` resources (`tauri.conf.json`), so the fetched binary is packaged automatically.

## Updating FFmpeg version

1. Pick an exact FFmpeg archive.
2. Update `build/ffmpeg.json` with new URL + checksums.
3. Re-run `bun run prepare:ffmpeg`.
4. Validate recording and app build.

## Current pinned version

- `8.1` essentials build (`win-x64`)
